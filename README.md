<h1>The hayok Developer Test developed by Muze Etoma Johnson muzeetoma16@gmail.com</h1>
<p>I have completed the test set for the interview</p>
<br>
Languages used: PHP, MYSQL
<br>
Frameworks used: LARAVEL, Bootstrap
<p>
I have created seeders for the dummy healthworkers data in database/UsersTableSeeder.php
<br>
Each user(health worker and patient) have login details(email and password)<br>
which are their 'names'@gmail.com e.g idris@gmail.com<br>
all passwords are '12345'
<br>    
when a health worker registers a patient, his password is '12345' as default e.g hunter@gmail.com with password 12345 is a patient
<br>
The program determines what dashboard to open after successful login by the user(health worker and patient)   
<br>
All routes are protected by middlewares to avoid patient accessing healthworkers page and vice versa
<br>  
The chat system has been fully implemented with left and right positioning and with date and time set underneath each message     
<br>    
All functionalities as well as proper commenting have been completed...
